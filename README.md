# Face-Recognititon
This project implements the concept of Siamese Neural Networks for one-shot image recognition, as proposed in the paper titled "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition" [Link](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf). The system leverages the power of deep learning to recognize and verify faces with high accuracy using minimal training data. By employing Siamese architecture and techniques, the model can effectively learn facial features and generalize to recognize unseen faces with only a single example.
